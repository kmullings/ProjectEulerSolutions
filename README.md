ProjectEulerSolutions
=====================

Project Euler Solutions in C#

I solved problems 1-7 (3 is incomplete).  I will be uploading it to AppHarbor @ projecteuler-1.apphb.com.  I'm also thinking of launching ProjectEulerSolutions.net.  Over time, I will increase the efficiency of the code but this is all I had time for :)

I created it using ASP.NET MVC w/a SQL Server back-end.  I went through all that so that I could demonstrate a wide range of code applications and so that I can easily add more solutions in the future.

My next release will complete problem 3 and encapsulate the solutions engine into a web service layer (overkill? Yes but it's for demo purposes).
